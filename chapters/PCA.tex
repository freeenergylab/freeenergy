\section{Principal Component Analysis\label{Sec:DR:PCA}}
Principal component analysis (PCA) was first developed by Hotelling in 1933.\cite{HotellingJEP1933} There have been many excellent review and tutorial of this method. For a (probably) most recent one, please refer to Ref.~\cite{GreenacreNRMP2022}

Principal component analysis is a versatile statistical method that combines information linearly from $n$ variables observed on the same objects into $r$ variables, called principal components, where $r\ll n$.
